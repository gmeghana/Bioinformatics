This is an instruction of using all the scripts:

generate.R
use polyester to generate the short reads based on cDNA

generate2.R
use polyester to generate the short reads based on randomly sampled protein coding DNA

Merge1.sh and Merge2.sh 
Merge the sample with same name (sample01.fasta, sample02.fasta, etc) in folder single_error0_cDNA and single_error1_cDNA,respectively.

run_all.sh
the bash to run all the three methods (need to change the dir in this script to the dir you put these methods)

run_rnaskim_v2.sh(in RNASkim/src)
bash to run RNASkim

run_kallisto_v2.sh(in kallisto/)
bash to run Kallisto

run_sailfish_v2.sh (in SailfishBeta-0.10.0_CentOS5/bin)
bash to sun Sailfish

groundTruth_each_sample:
Calculate the groundTruth of each sample.
RUN the script in M229s/ (parent dir of folder "scripts")
The groundTruth of each sample can be find in each folder.

parseFasta.py
Calculate the ground truth of cDNA reads

filter_100.py
build a filter to select reads equal or longer than 100 bp.

ChangeFormat.py
change the cDNA into specialized format that used in RNASkim

changeFormage_protein_coding.py
change the protein coding DNA file with specialized format into the format can be used in polyerster.
>T1 gene:G1
ATT...

RandomTrans.py
randomly sample 5% protein coding DNA
