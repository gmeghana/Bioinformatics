Project 1 By Meghana Ginjpalli (804588573)

For this project, I used Python 2.7.10 on a Mac OS.

In order to run this program, make sure that the text files are in the same folder as the project1.py file and type:
	python project1.py [name of txt file]

The output prints out the basic score, advanced score, and the table of log posterior probability density.
